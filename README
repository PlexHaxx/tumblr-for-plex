INSTALLATION

Simply escort Tumblr.bundle into the bosom of ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/

DISCLAIMER

I'm no programmer. In fact, this is my very first stab at anything in Python.

I cobbled what's here together from bits of other plug-ins and make no guarantee that it'll work anywhere other than on my own machine. How lovely it'd be if someone more capable than me were able/inclined to develop it into something slightly less amateur.

PS

Yes, I know Resources/art-default.jpg and Resources/web-flickr-logo.png contain Flickr graphics. It was low on the priorities list to change them...
